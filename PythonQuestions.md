Below are the answers to the questions:

### Slots

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 1 | What are `__slots__` in Python? | `__slots__` is a mechanism that prevents the creation of a default `__dict__` for instance attributes, saving memory by allocating space for a fixed set of attributes. |
| 2 | Write sample code using `__slots__`. | refer below code |
```python
class MyClass:
    __slots__ = ['attr1', 'attr2']
    
    def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
        self.attr1 = attr1
        self.attr2 = attr2

obj = MyClass(10, 20)
print(obj.attr1, obj.attr2)
``` 


### Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 3 | What is the GIL in Python? | The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes simultaneously. This ensures that only one thread executes in the Python interpreter at once, making Python thread-safe but limiting the execution of multi-threaded programs. |



```python
print("")






print("")
```


### Method Resolution Order (MRO)

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 4 | What is the MRO in Python? | Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. It is determined using the C3 linearization algorithm, ensuring a consistent order in class hierarchies, especially with multiple inheritance. |
| 5 | Explain MRO in detail. | The MRO ensures that each class is considered before its superclass. It is computed by the C3 linearization algorithm, which merges the MROs of the parents while preserving their order and ensuring that a class appears before any of its subclasses. This is crucial for consistent method resolution and avoiding potential conflicts in multiple inheritance. |
| 6 | How can you view the MRO of a class? | Use the `ClassName.__mro__` attribute or the `ClassName.mro()` method. |
| 7 | Example of viewing MRO. | refer below code |

```python
class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(A): pass
class D(B, C): pass

print(D.__mro__)

# Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
``` 

### Metaclass

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 8 | What is a metaclass in Python? | A metaclass is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass. In Python, `type` is the default metaclass, but custom metaclasses can be created by inheriting from `type`. |
| 9 | Explain metaclass in detail. | Metaclasses are powerful tools that allow customization of class creation and behavior. When a class is defined, Python uses its metaclass to create it. The metaclass can modify the class definition, add or modify methods, and control class inheritance. This allows for advanced patterns like singleton classes, auto-registering classes, and more. |
| 10 | Write sample code using a metaclass. | refer below code |

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['greet'] = lambda self: f"Hello from {self.__class__.__name__}"
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct
class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.greet())  # Output: Hello from MyClass
``` 

### Context Manager

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 11 | Explain context manager in Python. | A context manager in Python is a construct that allows setup and teardown actions to be performed around a block of code. It is commonly used with `with` statements to ensure resources are properly managed, such as opening and closing files. |
| 12 | How to write a context manager? | You can write a context manager using a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, or using the `contextlib` module's `contextmanager` decorator. |
| 13 | Write sample code for a context manager using a class. | refer below code |

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")

with MyContextManager():
    print("Inside the context")
```

```
# Output:
# Entering the context
# Inside the context
# Exiting the context





.
```

| No | Question | Answer |
|----|----------|--------|
| 14 | Write sample code for a context manager using `contextlib`. | refer below code | 

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context():
    print("Entering the context")
    yield
    print("Exiting the context")

with my_context():
    print("Inside the context")
```

```
# Output:
# Entering the context
# Inside the context
# Exiting the context

| 3  | How does PySpark relate to the Hadoop ecosystem? | PySpark can run on Hadoop clusters and can leverage Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) for storage and processing. |
| 4  | What is Apache HDFS? | Apache HDFS is the distributed file system used by Hadoop for storing data across multiple machines. |
| 5  | What is MapReduce? | MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique for distributed computing based on Java. |
| 6  | How does Spark compare to MapReduce? | Spark is faster than MapReduce because it performs in-memory processing, while MapReduce writes intermediate results to disk. |
| 7  | What is YARN? | YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is the resource management layer in Hadoop that manages resources across the cluster. |
| 8  | How do you install and configure Hadoop? | Install Hadoop by downloading the distribution and configuring the core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, and mapred-site.xml files. |
| 9  | How do you submit a PySpark job to a Hadoop cluster? | Use the `spark-submit` command with the appropriate options and arguments. |
