Comparison between **Canary** and **Rolling** deployments :


| **Aspect**                      | **Canary Deployment**                                               | **Rolling Deployment**                                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                  | Deploying a new version to a small subset of users or servers first before gradually rolling it out to the entire infrastructure. | Gradually replacing the old version of an application with the new version across all servers or instances, one at a time. |
| **Purpose**                     | To minimize risk by testing the new version in production with real users on a limited basis. | To update all instances of an application with minimal downtime and risk. |
| **Traffic Control**             | Traffic is initially routed to a small percentage of users. Gradually, more traffic is directed to the new version if no issues are found. | All instances gradually receive the new version as the old version is replaced in a controlled sequence. |
| **Rollback Strategy**           | Easy to roll back, as only a small percentage of users are affected. The majority of traffic is still handled by the old version. | Rollback is more complex, as multiple instances might already be running the new version. |
| **Use Cases**                   | Ideal for applications where you want to test new features or changes with a subset of users before a full-scale rollout. | Suitable for applications that need to be updated across all instances but can't afford significant downtime. |
| **Deployment Speed**            | Slower, as it requires monitoring and decision points before increasing the percentage of users seeing the new version. | Generally faster, as the update is applied progressively to all instances without waiting for user feedback. |
| **Monitoring Requirements**     | High level of monitoring is needed to track the impact on the subset of users and detect any issues early. | Standard monitoring is needed to ensure that each instance update is successful and that there are no service disruptions. |
| **Complexity**                  | More complex to set up, requiring precise traffic routing, monitoring, and decision-making processes. | Simpler to implement compared to canary deployments, as it follows a more straightforward update process. |
| **Resource Usage**              | May require running both old and new versions simultaneously on different sets of instances, leading to higher resource usage during the deployment phase. | Typically requires less additional resource usage, as only a small number of instances are being updated at any given time. |
| **Risk Level**                  | Lower risk for widespread issues, as the impact of any problem is limited to a small subset of users initially. | Moderate risk, as issues could potentially impact a significant portion of the user base as the rollout progresses. |
| **Example Scenario**            | Deploying a new feature that significantly changes the user experience, such as a redesign of the user interface. | Rolling out a minor version update or a patch that fixes bugs across all servers. |
| **Traffic Distribution Tools**  | Requires tools like feature flags, traffic routing services, or load balancers to control and monitor traffic distribution. | Usually relies on Kubernetes deployments or CI/CD tools to manage the progressive update process. |
| **Gradual Rollout**             | Gradual increase in traffic to the new version based on predefined metrics and success criteria. | Gradual update of instances, but once an instance is updated, it immediately serves 100% of its traffic with the new version. |
| **Downtime**                    | Minimal, as only a small subset of users might experience issues, and the system can quickly roll back if necessary. | Minimal, as the update process ensures that some instances are always available to handle traffic. |

### Summary:

- **Canary Deployments**: Focus on reducing risk by testing with a small user base before rolling out fully. It's ideal when changes could have significant impact or need close monitoring.
- **Rolling Deployments**: Focus on updating the application gradually across all servers with minimal disruption. It’s suited for routine updates or changes that don’t require user-specific feedback during deployment.

Both methods aim to achieve zero-downtime deployments, but the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the application and the organization's risk tolerance.
