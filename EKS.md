## EKS

Various components, services, and sub-services in an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster:

### **1. EKS Cluster Overview**
An EKS cluster is a managed Kubernetes service on AWS that provides a scalable and secure platform for running containerized applications. AWS manages the control plane, while you manage the worker nodes that run the Kubernetes workloads.

### **2. EKS Control Plane**
The control plane is the brain of the EKS cluster, responsible for managing the Kubernetes API and the state of the cluster. AWS fully manages the control plane, which includes:

- **API Server**: The entry point for all administrative tasks. It exposes the Kubernetes API.
- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that holds the state of the cluster.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
- **Controller Manager**: Ensures that the desired state of the cluster matches the current state. It manages tasks like node lifecycles, replication controllers, and endpoint management.

### **3. Worker Nodes**
Worker nodes are the machines (EC2 instances) that run your containerized applications. Each node includes:

- **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node and ensures containers are running in a pod.
- **Kube-proxy**: Manages network communication between pods and services, providing load balancing.
- **Container Runtime**: The software that runs containers. Docker or containerd is typically used.

### **4. Node Groups**
Node groups are collections of worker nodes. EKS allows you to create and manage node groups easily:

- **Managed Node Groups**: AWS automates the creation, updating, and scaling of these groups.
- **Self-Managed Node Groups**: You manage the lifecycle of the nodes yourself, giving you more control but also more responsibility.

### **5. Namespaces**
Namespaces are used to organize and isolate resources within a Kubernetes cluster. They are particularly useful in environments with multiple teams or projects. Key points include:

- **Resource Quotas**: Limit resources (e.g., CPU, memory) available within a namespace.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Controls who can perform what actions within a namespace.

### **6. Pods**
Pods are the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Each pod contains:

- **Containers**: One or more containers running inside the pod, sharing the same network namespace and storage volumes.
- **Shared Storage**: Volumes that can be mounted by containers in the pod, allowing them to share data.

### **7. Containers**
Containers are the actual runnable units inside pods. Containers run your applications and are based on container images, which include everything the application needs to run:

- **Container Image**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
- **Registry**: A storage and content delivery system, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR, where container images are stored.

### **8. Services**
Services define a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. They provide stable endpoints for a set of pods, ensuring that if a pod dies and gets recreated, the IP addresses don’t change:

- **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on an internal IP in the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on the same port of each selected node in the cluster.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **Headless Services**: Used when you don’t need or want load balancing, often for stateful applications.

### **9. Ingress**
Ingress manages external access to services in the cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS. It can provide:

- **Routing**: Routes traffic to the correct service based on URL paths or hostnames.
- **TLS/SSL Termination**: Handles HTTPS traffic and terminates SSL, offloading this task from the services.
- **Authentication**: Implements authentication policies for external requests.

### **10. ConfigMaps and Secrets**
These are used to inject configuration data and sensitive information (like passwords) into your applications:

- **ConfigMaps**: Store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.
- **Secrets**: Store confidential data, which is encoded to keep it secure.

### **11. Persistent Volumes (PVs) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**
Kubernetes abstracts storage into PVs and PVCs to manage persistent data:

- **Persistent Volumes (PVs)**: Storage resources provisioned by an administrator or dynamically through storage classes.
- **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**: Requests for storage by a user, which automatically binds to a PV.

### **12. Networking**
EKS uses several networking components to manage communication between resources:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Provides network isolation for your EKS cluster.
- **Subnets**: Separate the VPC into smaller networks, isolating resources for security and management.
- **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources in your VPC.
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Used to control traffic to and from subnets and nodes.

### **13. Monitoring and Logging**
EKS integrates with several AWS services to provide monitoring and logging:

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Collects and visualizes metrics from your applications and resources.
- **AWS X-Ray**: Provides distributed tracing for applications.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Logs API calls to AWS services, providing audit trails.
- **Kubernetes Metrics Server**: Provides resource usage metrics (CPU, memory) for pods and nodes.

### **14. Autoscaling**
EKS supports autoscaling at multiple levels:

- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on CPU/memory usage or other custom metrics.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**: Adjusts the CPU and memory requests and limits for containers in a pod based on their usage.

### **15. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
EKS integrates with AWS IAM to manage permissions and access to resources:

- **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**: Allows fine-grained permissions at the pod level by associating IAM roles with Kubernetes service accounts.
- **IAM Roles**: Used to grant permissions to Kubernetes nodes and control plane components.

### **16. Security**
Security in EKS is managed through multiple layers:

- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Controls access to the Kubernetes API and resources within the cluster.
- **Pod Security Policies**: Define the conditions under which a pod can run in the cluster.
- **Network Policies**: Define how pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

### **17. CI/CD Integration**
EKS integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate application deployments:

- **AWS CodePipeline**: A CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your application.
- **GitOps**: Use tools like ArgoCD or Flux to manage Kubernetes clusters using Git repositories as the source of truth for the desired state.

This covers the key components and services within an EKS cluster. 
Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the Kubernetes workloads are scalable, secure, and highly available.
