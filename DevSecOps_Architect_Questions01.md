If an issue is detected during the update, Kubernetes can pause the rollout or automatically rollback to the previous stable version. This approach ensures smooth transitions between versions with minimal disruption to the application. |
| 26 | What are Kubernetes ConfigMaps, and how are they used? | ConfigMaps in Kubernetes are objects that allow you to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. ConfigMaps can be used to inject configuration files, command-line arguments, environment variables, or entire files into containers at runtime. This decouples configuration from container images, making it easier to manage and update configurations without redeploying applications. ConfigMaps are often used in conjunction with secrets and volumes to manage application settings in a Kubernetes environment. |
| 27 | Explain the concept of Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in Kubernetes. | Persistent Volumes (PV) in Kubernetes are storage resources provisioned by an administrator or dynamically through storage classes. They provide a way to persist data beyond the lifecycle of a pod. Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are requests for storage by a user or application, specifying the desired size and access modes. A PVC is bound to a PV that meets its requirements, allowing the pod to access the storage. This abstraction allows developers to manage storage independently from the underlying infrastructure, ensuring data persistence and portability across Kubernetes environments. |
