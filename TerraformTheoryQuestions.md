| 5  | Can Terraform manage on-premises infrastructure? | Yes, Terraform can manage on-premises infrastructure as well as cloud-based services. |
| 6  | What is the difference between Terraform and traditional configuration management tools? | Terraform focuses on infrastructure provisioning and uses a declarative approach, while configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet focus on the configuration and management of software and use an imperative approach. |
| 7  | What is a Terraform configuration file? | A Terraform configuration file is a text file with a `.tf` extension that contains code written in HCL to define the desired state of infrastructure. |
| 8  | How does Terraform's declarative approach work? | Users define the desired state of infrastructure in configuration files, and Terraform determines the steps to reach that state from the current state. |
| 9  | What is Terraform's execution plan? | Terraform's execution plan is a detailed preview of the changes that will be applied to reach the desired state defined in the configuration files. |
| 10 | Explain the term "idempotency" in the context of Terraform. | Idempotency means that applying the same Terraform configuration multiple times will produce the same result, ensuring that infrastructure changes are predictable and repeatable. |
| 11 | What is the main file structure for a Terraform project? | Typically, a Terraform project includes `.tf` files for configuration, `.tfstate` files for state, and `.tfvars` files for variables. |
| 12 | How does Terraform handle infrastructure drift? | Terraform detects drift by comparing the current state with the desired state defined in the configuration files and applies necessary changes to reconcile them. |
